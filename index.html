		<p>VTEC is a serious problem here in Ireland for those of us living in
        rural areas. A lot of rural homes and  especially farms are getting their primary source of water from private wells. <br><br>It's these wells that are at risk of being contaminated due to animal runoff and a lack of maintenance. The aim of this animation was to focus on the farming community and try to raise awarness through a way that's educational and hopefully funny.</p>
